# Service-specific configuration file for tomcat7. This will be sourced by
# the SysV init script after the global configuration file
# /etc/tomcat7/tomcat7.conf, thus allowing values to be overridden in
# a per-service manner.
#
# NEVER change the init script itself. To change values for all services make
# your changes in /etc/tomcat7/tomcat7.conf
#
# To change values for a specific service make your edits here.
# To create a new service create a link from /etc/init.d/<your new service> to
# /etc/init.d/tomcat7 (do not copy the init script) and make a copy of the
# /etc/sysconfig/tomcat7 file to /etc/sysconfig/<your new service> and change
# the property values so the two services won't conflict. Register the new
# service in the system as usual (see chkconfig and similars).
